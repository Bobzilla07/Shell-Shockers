This webpage will appear to load for a really really really really long time. That's ok! Even if you get a 504 Gateway Timed Out error. It's ok!\n2. You can close it immediately, or wait for the webpage to load at which point your email would have been sent already.\n3. Check your emails for the link.\n4. Play!\n\nIf something doesn't look like it worked, like the webpage didn't load at all or you see some weird error messages, send an email to pigeonproxy@adrian.id.au and we'll get it sorted.")
