    <h1>PigeonProxy</h1>
    <h3>play shellshock.io with friends at school!</h3>
    <p>
        PigeonProxy lets you play private games of <a href="https://yolk.best">Shell Shockers</a> with your friends, under any filtering service that uses the PAN-DB filtering and categorisation IP/URL database from Palo Alto Networks (which means, at school!)<br><br>

        Blue Wizard Digital releases alternate URLs for Shell Shockers, and while most of them are blocked, some of them do work!! Unfortunately, there is one problematic issue - it doesn't show you the join link while playing in private lobbies... and that's where PigeonProxy comes in - it'll create a game for you to play with you and your friends!<br>

        <ul>
            <li>If you're interested in the technical tidbits about PigeonProxy, visit the official project Google Doc <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UA4LpxPjmrwpQwIoFoXCzsodPXYq7hSnbY52iydH0zI/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</li>
            <li>If you're just a normal user who wants to lear how to use PigeonProxy to set up games for you and your friends, you'll find the official instruction manual <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-Jme2uSqgeaNkweX0GFIPHLPx5xIMq4xv8GrFBM-oSA/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</li>

        <p><strong class="tip">tip!</strong> we've set the tab name of this webpage to say Google Classroom to make things a bit more inconspicious! but please don't play during class :(</p>
