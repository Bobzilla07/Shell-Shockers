            <p>
                Currently, any games started through PigeonProxy will be published on the below database. In the future, we plan to add a feature that lets you decide whether you'd like to announce games made on PigeonProxy, or keep it a secret.<br>

                For now, this database is only viewable for people at SAC but this is a temporary phenomenon and once exams are over I'll introduce a proper game finding system.<br>

                You can also view this database at <a href=""
